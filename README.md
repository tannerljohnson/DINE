## User Documentation

When a user first signs in with their Google account, they are asked to complete their profile information. This is where they can log in as a admin, recipient, or student user type (detailed below).  The other information needed depends on the user type. Once they submit their information, they are taken to the home page.

### User Types

**Admin**: The admin users, which are the food vendors, are the ones who initiate the order.  They provide the specific details about the food that is available to be taken to a community member.

**Recipient**: The recipient user is the community member who requests the food order that was posted by the admin.

**Student**: The student user can sign up to take a specific order to a community member.  The student can earn points and rewards for the orders that they complete.

Overall, each user has the same basic activities.

At all times, there is a drop down menu at the top left that contains the buttons to Home, Calendar, My Orders, and Log Out. 

The home screen has some of the users account information on it, such as the optional profile picture, number of points, and whether or not they have pending orders.  

The Calendar Page is accessible to all users and shows a basic view of a calendar.  When a user clicks on a day, the orders that currently exist on that day appear.  The user can then view the information and sign up for that order. 

The My Orders page contains a list of all the orders that the user is involved with.  If the user taps on an Order, they can view the Order’s information.

### Orders

Accessible either through Calendar page or My Orders page.

Order Timeline:
1. Admin creates an new Order with the Calendar page.
2. Student signs up to deliver the Order.
3. Recipient signs up to accept the Order.
4. Student can now view the number and address of recipient. The student can tap on the recipient’s address to open it in Google Maps or they can tap on the Street View button to view the Google Maps street view of the address.
5. Recipient confirms they received the Order once it was delivered.
6. Student is then rewarded with points that can be used for rewards.
